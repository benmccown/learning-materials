A collection of resources that have helped me through the years.

## Career Paths

[roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) has excellent learning paths for different development tracks. If you're still in high scool or college then you don't need to commit yourself to only one of these learning paths. These paths are a great resource for learning about new technology you might not have heard of, so check them out and see if anything catches your interest.

- [Backend](https://roadmap.sh/backend)
- [DevOps](https://roadmap.sh/devops)

[Coursera has a nice article](https://www.coursera.org/articles/it-career-paths-how-to-get-started) covering some of the career paths available to you with a computer science or computer information systems degree. If you're looking to seriously commit yourself to a career and strive for a top earning position then Software Engineering, DevOps (and Cloud related positions), and Cybersecurity will be the most lucrative but all of these paths pay fairly well.

## Learning

The most important thing is to find a learning method that works well for you individually. I have used a solid mix of books as well as video resources so I can provide resources for these categories.

I highly recommend finding a topic you're interested in and learning that. Picking a topic to learn just for the sake of feeling like you need to isn't going to carry you very far.

### Programming

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) is a site that allows you to buy courses for $10-$15 which you'll own forever (no subscription fee). I highly recommend the investment for any topics you want to tackle. For example: Unity game development, Llarning Python, learning JavaScript (and web development), etc. All courses have reviews so you can find a highly rated one and view the curriculum before purchasing.
    - Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D - https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/
    - Python for Beginners: Learn Python Programming (Python 3) - https://www.udemy.com/course/python-programming-projects/
    - The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 - https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is a free online curriculum that is essentially a full web development bootcamp, similar to what you would get if you paid to attend one of the many coding bootcamps out there. Highly recommended.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a similar resource to the Odin Project. In fact, the Odin Project actually sends you to freeCodeCamp for part of its own curriculum. Here they have courses that cover the following topics (all free).
    - Front End Development and Responsive Web Design
    - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
    - Data Visualization
    - Back End Development
    - Scientific Computing with Python
    - Data Analysis with Python
    - Information Security (Cyber Security)
    - Machine Learning
    - Interview Prep
- [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) is a book you'll see recommended once you get past the "just learning to program" phase and closer to the "career programmer" phase. It is an excellent resource and you can probably do some googling to find a PDF available. (Try searching "Library Genesis" at [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_).
- [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) is another intermediate/advanced level book that will help you understand systems at scale. If you wonder how you go from knowing how to program to designing applications at Google/Amazon/Facebook scale, this will cover it. PDFs are also findable for this one.
- YouTube has some excellent free resources where programmers will cover all sorts of topics. A great one is to search, "programming instagram clone" where you insert your favorite app (Netflix, Twitter, Discord, etc.) and there's plenty of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7T48W0cwXM) out there where someone will walk you through a tutorial where you create a simple knockoff using web development. Also lots of great data structures videos as well as tutorials for any programming language you can imagine.

### Interviewing

- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) is an excellent book which gives you a glimpse into the interview styles for major tech companies. This book also covers all of the data structures required to pass an interview with flying colors. Also findable as a PDF online.
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a website that allows you to practice data structures interview questions using a live code editor. On average you will be prepared for first rounds after college if you cover around 100-200 questions so that you can establish pattern recognition. This sounds like a lot but if you do 3 a day it is only a few months of consistent work.
- [NeetCode YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_mYaQAE6-71rjSN6CeCA-g) is a great resource that covers Leetcode questions and their optimal answers. Try finding questions on LeetCode that NeetCode covers and when you get stuck, watch the video.
- [Blind 75 LeetCode List](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) is a good list to work off of that covers all the major data structures you'll need to know.

## Misc

- The [CS Career Questions Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) and [IT Career Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/) subreddits are both excellent places to poke around and learn more about career options. You can ask questions here and generally everyone is pretty friendly. As with any online community there can be some toxicity too.
